1. Dry Dandruff (Dry Scalp Flakes)

Symptoms: Mild itching, flakes fall easily

2. Oily / Seborrheic Dandruff

Caused by: Excess scalp oil + yeast (Malassezia)

Symptoms: Red, inflamed, itchy scalp

3. Product-Buildup Dandruff

Appearance: Residue-like flakes from hair products

Caused by: Gels, sprays, or oils left on scalp

💡 My 7-Day Routine to Remove Dandruff Completely
🗓️ Day 1

Wash with Cipla Ketocip Ketoconazole Shampoo (leave on scalp 3–5 min)

Apply thin layer of pure aloe vera gel on scalp after drying

🗓️ Day 2

No wash — apply aloe vera gel only

🗓️ Day 3

Wash with Khadi Natural Neem & Aloevera Herbal Shampoo

Apply aloe vera gel again

🗓️ Day 4

No wash — let scalp rest

🗓️ Day 5

Use Ketoconazole shampoo again

Apply aloe vera afterward

🗓️ Day 6

No wash — aloe vera if itchy

🗓️ Day 7

Use herbal shampoo

Aloe vera gel to seal in moisture

📝 Important: Avoid oiling scalp during this week to prevent fungal growth and clogged pores.

🌱 How to Maintain a Healthy, Flake-Free Scalp

Wash hair 2–3 times weekly (alternate medicated + herbal shampoo)

Apply aloe vera gel regularly to soothe scalp

Use light oil (coconut/olive) only if scalp is dry — and in small amounts

Eat protein-rich, vitamin-rich foods and stay hydrated

Manage stress and get enough sleep — stress is a major dandruff trigger

✅ Final Thoughts

I struggled with stubborn dandruff for months. Once I followed this routine consistently, the flakes, itching, and scalp irritation disappeared completely in just one week.

If you are suffering from dandruff, try this plan exactly as described — and say goodbye to flakes for good!"
